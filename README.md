# yt-iframe

## A simple website with a youtube iframe to avoid the annoying youtube suggestions

Instead of watching videos on the youtube website or app and get distracted while doing work due the to how the UI is made, I made this website for a simple and minimalistic viewing experience. There is no video suggestions, no search, no side ads, no comments. Just what you need.
